# Wireless Coverage Simulation

This application implements genetic algorithm to search optimum coverage of Wifi devices. 
User can adjust the number of nodes(wifi reprensetative in this context), 
confirm the size of population which will be chromosomes (candidate solution ), and Algorithm will work according to some parameters. 

This is my old project,  I am a fan of demonstrating math science into visual presentation.  I only recently started using Git as my portfolio.
